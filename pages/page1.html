He is a music soul, just like the rest of our family. He likes to solve puzzles, or anything difficult, he loves a good challenge. Daniel was always the person in the family that I would go to for help in school, from math, to english, to almost every subject. When we started talking more about programming and he pushed me to make a couple things during summer, I knew I wanted to follow in his foot steps. He motivates me to do better, and to become successful. </p>
